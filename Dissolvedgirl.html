	<strong>Sol Pais</strong> (2001-02-01 - 2019-04-17), known online as <strong>lonelyangel444</strong> and <strong>dissolvedgirl</strong> on Neocities, was an 18-year-old woman from the United Sates, who was reportedly "obsessed" with the 1999 Columbine high school massacre, where two teenagers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, murdered 12 students and a teacher on the 20th of April. On the 16th of April 2019 she managed to shut down Columbine High School along with many others, affecting more than 400,000 students in the Denver area, ahead of the 20th anniversary of the shooting, after she made comments in person and online in related to her "infatuation" with the Columbine shootings.

FBI Denver special agent in charge Dean Phillips said that "a combination of her actions and comments" alerted authorities to Pais as a possible threat. It should be of note that it is not known of her comments, or even if she even said that she had any intent to harm another person. Along with the comments, she also purchased three one-way tickets to Denver from Miami for the 15th, 16th, and the 17th of April, before she took the first flight on Monday the 15th. Mr. Phillips said that Sol Pais went directly to legally purchase a pump-action shotgun, along with ammunition.

CBS News reported that nearly 30 armed officers swarm the woods near the Echo Park Campground in the Arapaho National Forest, nearby to where she was reportedly found. Echo Park Campground was not planned to open until late May 2019 due to weather. Witnesses to the event told local media that she was seen running nude and armed with a gun in the area earlier on the in the week.

Clear Creek County Sheriff Rick Albers said that she was found dead when law enforcement officials found her, suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot. Her body was removed from the Resthouse Trail near Echo Lake Lodge around 13:30.
