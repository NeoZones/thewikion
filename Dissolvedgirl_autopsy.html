<h1>Dissolvedgirl/autopsy/</h1>
	Here is a copy of what is apparently the full autopsy report of Pais that took place on 2019-04-19, three days after her death. The report was posted by Reddit user Luca261 on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/dissolvedgirl/comments/cws1ou/sol_pais_autopsy_report/">the dissolvedgirl subreddit</a>. A breakdown of the report, plus full context for people who do not know the story behind it, can be <a href="Dissolvedgirl_autopsy_summary.html">found here</a>.

	A text version can be found <a href="Dissolvedgirl_autopsy_text.html">here</a>, while a TXT version can be found <a href="Dissolvedgirl_autopsy_txt.html">here</a>.
	<p>
	The report would likely be in the public domain (no copyright), as it is a work of the US government (on the request of the Clear Creek County Coroner's Office), made as part of that person's official duties. As a work of the US federal government, the report is in the public domain.
