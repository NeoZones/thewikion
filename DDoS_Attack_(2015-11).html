<h1>DDoS Attack (2015-11)</h1>
In a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single source.
<p>
A DoS or DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door of a shop, making it hard for legitimate customers to enter, disrupting trade.</p>
<p>
Around the 2015-11-10, owner of Neocities, Kyle Drake received a Denial-of-service attack ransom. Instead of caving in and bowing down to the publicly unknown ransom, Kyle Drake replied to the sender by telling them to "fuck off".</p>
<p>
As a direct result, the sender DDoSed Neocities, however, neocities.org handled the DDoS just fine. At the same time, Kyle watched Bob Ross and went to sleep.</p>
<p>
The next day, Kyle Drake would recount this event on his Twitter account by writing;</p>
<p>
<blockquote><tt>
    Neocities got a DDoS ransom. I replied "fuck off". They DDoSed, our mitigation handled it. I watched Bob Ross and went to sleep. #cyberpunk
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
Who the attacker was, why they wanted to attack Neocities, and even what the ransom was is still unknown.</p>
