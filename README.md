# The Wiki on Neocities Mirror

Hello there, this is the full dump of [https://thewikion.neocities.org](https://thewikion.neocities.org) that can be downloaded, viewed, and edited at your enjoyment. Since we moved the wiki from [Neocities](https://neocities.org) to [its own domain](https://wiki.neozones.club), the old one has become outdated, as stated in the landing page, the old one didn't have the benefit of showing us when content was added, removed, and also not telling us who made an edit to a page.

So yeah, it's outdated in many places, but some of the articles are worth a read (even if they are a bit outdated), I guess, regardless, enjoy.
