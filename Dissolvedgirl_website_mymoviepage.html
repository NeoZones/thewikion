<a href="https://dissolvedgirl.neocities.org/mymoviepage.html"><strong>MY MOVIE PAGG</strong> (or "MOVIES" by the title header of the page)</a>, is <A href="Dissolvedgirl/website/dreamworlds.html">one of two previously unknown webpages from Sol Pais' website</a>. One of the main reasons for it not being known about is simply because it was unlisted (no other page linked to it). The website was found 11 months after the death of the teenager on 2020-03-26 by Neocities member, OwlMan, who wrote on the NeoZones Discord server; "Thanks to me downloading a map of all of Neocities, I have found not one, but two previously unknown pages on Sol Pais' website. They are so unknown, that they were not even touched by the Internet Archive's web crawler bot when I found them".
<p>
One of the main reasons why the webpage was unlisted was probably because it was never finished and was still a work in progress; no movies at all were indexed and the only text on the page was simply "WELCOME TO MY MOVIE PAGE" and "under construction".
<p>
<h2>Source Code Errors</h2>
Despite being only 11 lines long, the webpage has a few errors; line 4 and 8 both have a stray <tt>&#x3C;body&#x3E;</tt> tag, line 7 has a stray <tt>&#x3C;/head></tt> tag, and finally, line 10 has this on it;
<p>
<blockquote>&#x3C;tt&#x3E; &#x3C;p style=&#x22;color:white;text-align:center;&#x22;&#x3E; under construction &#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/tt&#x3E;</blockquote>
<p>
It makes use of the <tt>&#x3C;tt&#x3E;</tt> and correctly closes it, however, it also makes use of the <tt>&#x3C;p&#x3E;</tt> tag, but this tag is ''not'' closed, instead another <tt>&#x3C;p&#x3E;</tt> is used. Both are not closed.
<p>
<h2>History of The Page</h2>
As noted by OwlMan, the "Internet Archive's web crawler bot [had never saved the page]" when they found it, so the only save of the page of note would have been the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200326004845/https://dissolvedgirl.neocities.org/mymoviepage.html">archive made on the day the the page was re-found</a>.
