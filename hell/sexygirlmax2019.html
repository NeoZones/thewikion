<h3>This article is in /hell/!</h3>
<p>
This article has been moved to /hell/ as the article is quite bare bones right now. This article needs to have more content to it, and not just a PM between OwlMan, and Bugland.</p>

This is nothing like the final product, the tl;dr is that SexyGirlMax2019 was a bot on Tumblr, but unlike most bots that post pr0n, this one posted weird links and the such. I didn't have the time to go down the rabbit hole that is SexyGirlMax2019. 
<p>
The bot has a subreddit where people try and find out what the bot is all about: https://www.reddit.com/r/sexygirlmax2019/top/ also checkout the Discord server
<p>
I first found out about this bot thanks to bugland on Neocities, who PMed me one day with this;
<tt>
<p>
[11:07] bugland: In any case, have you seen the potential arg people are hosting partially on neocities that's all over twitter and tumblr? You seem like you'd be vaguely interested.
<p>
[11:09] bugland: https://mobile.twitter.com/cheorryeclipse/status/1010311948234305536 I'll link you this just in case, i guess. Sorry for repeating others if you already know though!
<p>
[23:51] OwlMan: That looks interesting, that's the first time that I've heard about this ARG. I'll be keeping my eyes on it.
