<h3>This article is in /hell/!</h3>
<p>
This article has been moved to /hell/ as archive.org, and neocities.org doesn't necessarily go hand-in-hand. With this, <a href="/wiki/decentralized_web_summit.html">another article on archive.org was made</a>.</p>
<p>
To move this article out of /hell/, then this page needs to talk about how the Internet Archive is related to Neocities.</p>

<p>Founded in 1996 in San Francisco, California, The Internet Archive is a nonprofit digital library with the mission of "universal access to all knowledge". The archive is made up of free public access to collections of digitized materials, including websites, software applications/games, music, movies/videos, moving images, and nearly three million public-domain books.</p>
<img src="/wiki/img/internet_archive.png" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
<p>In addition to its archiving function, the Archive is an activist organization, advocating for a free and open Internet.</p>
<p>The Internet Archive allows any member of the public to upload, and download digital material to its data cluster, however, despite having human users who save digital material, the bulk of its data is collected automatically by its <a href="robots_txt.html">web crawlers</a>, which work to preserve as much of the public Web as possible. Its web archive, the Wayback Machine, contains over 308 billion web captures. The Archive also oversees one of the world's largest book digitization projects.</p>
