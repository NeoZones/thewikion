Around September of 2015, British Neocities member, Captain_Hawkes, published two of his Doom II WADs


Around September 2015, Captain_Hawkes released two of his own Doom maps; Monastery of Apostasy and Carcass Causeway. Both of the WADs play under Doom II. Out of both of the maps, Monastery of Apostasy is perhaps the easiest to beat, as in total there are four archviles in Carcass Causeway, while in the latter there are none.
