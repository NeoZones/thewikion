<em>Man Mad Font</em> (also know as "Man_Man_Font"), is a font that was made for <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/comic/comic/6/" target="_blank">issue 
number six</A> of the <a href="owlman_comic.html">OwlMan Comic</A> by English Neocities user, <a href="people_owlman.html">OwlMan</A>.

The font was first used by an unknown homeless looking character, who was preaching about how "the end of the comic is coming". The comic was first published on the 30th of May 2016, to little to no success.<p>
<p>
No other uses of the font being used is known, this is probably due to the fact that the font is very poorly made. An example of the font being used is seen on the left.</p>
<p>
In January 2018, OwlMan made an <a href="https://archive.org/details/ManManFont" target="_blank">archive of the font</A>. On the archive page, OwlMan wrote that it was "A shitty font from a shitty WebComic".
