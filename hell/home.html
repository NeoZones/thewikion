<h2><em>Welcome to Hell!</em></h2>
Greeting, and welcome to the part of the WWW people in school warned you about. This part of the wiki is for articles that aren't very good, and rather than deleting them, we send them to Hell. If you want to give an article here a second chance (or "<em>repent</em>" if you will) then you should read the pinned message found on each article in here, so you can understand what's wrong with it.
<p>
But until that day, please enjoy you day in /hell/!</p>
