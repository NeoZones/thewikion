Neocities is a free web hosting service started in 2013 by Kyle Drake, offering 1 GB of storage space and no server-side scripting for free. Neocities' goal is to revive the support of "creativity and free expression" provided by GeoCities before its partial shutdown. On this page, you may see the (very unofficial) history of the web hosting service.
