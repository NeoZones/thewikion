The landing page has had a few changes over the time that Penny's Pages has been online. Here are of the versions of the landing page that were used.</p>
<p>
<h1>First index used</h1>
The first index that was used was only online for a matter of days after it was updated. The GIF used wasn't the best quality, and that was the main reason why it was removed.
<p>

<h2>Halloween 2018 index</h2>
This is the 2018 Halloween index, it was made by OwlMan, and <a href="https://neocities.org/site/pizzalair">Pizza Squeeze</A>.
