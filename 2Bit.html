<strong><a href="https://2bit.neocities.org">2Bit</a></strong> is the name of a 1990's themed website notable for its use of a literal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#2-bit_color">2-bit</a> graphics (meaning it uses four colors, rather than a greater amount, as seen with other websites), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160925183243/https://2bit.neocities.org/docs/updates.html">created in late 2015</a>.
<p>
The contents for the site includes a collection of over <a href="https://2bit.neocities.org/gameboycamera.html">100 Game Boy Camera photos</a>, off the site in 2016, 2Bit was featured in "GeoCities Sites: The Internet in the 90s", an article written by Kuro Pixel where they write that "<a href="https://www.kuropixel.com/geocities-sites/">The person that made [2Bit] is really dedicated to [the theme of having everything in 2-bit color], because all graphics follow the rules of being 2 bit. Not a lot of real content on the site, but it's pretty unique so I thought I'd mention it</a>".</p>
<p>
The owner of 2Bit was also the creator of the now defunct <a href="NeoForums.html">NeoForums</a>, that shut down sometime around 2017-12.</p>
