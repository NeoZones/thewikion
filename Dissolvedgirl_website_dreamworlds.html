<a href="https://dissolvedgirl.neocities.org/dreamworlds.html"><strong>DREAM REALITY</strong></a> is one of two previously unknown webpages from Sol Pais' website. One of the main reasons for it not being known about is simply because it was unlisted (no other page linked to it). The website was found 11 months after the death of the teenager on 2020-03-26 by Neocities member, OwlMan, who wrote on the NeoZones Discord server; "Thanks to me downloading a map of all of Neocities, I have found not one, but two previously unknown pages on Sol Pais' website. They are so unknown, that they were not even touched by the Internet Archive's web crawler bot when I found them".
<p>
Unlike <a href="Dissolvedgirl_website_mymoviepage.html">the other</a> re-found page, this one is seemly finished, although it doesn't seem to hold all that much purpose, as all there is on the page is just static with the title of "DREAM REALITY".
<p>
<h2>Source Code Errors</h2>
As the page is just a GIF file of black and white static, unsurprisingly, the source for it isn't that long, only 15 lines in fact, despite of this, there are 3 errors.
<p>
Line 4 has a misplaced <tt>&#x3C;head&#x3E;</tt> tag, line 7 ends this tag, but in the wrong place, while on line 8, it has a misplaced <tt>&#x3C;body&#x3E;</tt> tag. While not a technical error, lines 9 to 13 and 15 make use of whitespace (meaning just blankness), Sol Pais could have saved (admittedly a small amount of) space by just not having these lines in the published version of the page.

<h2>History of The Page</h2>
As noted by OwlMan, the "Internet Archive's web crawler bot [had never saved the page]" when they found it, so the only save of the page of note would have been the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200326004837/https://dissolvedgirl.neocities.org/dreamworlds.html">archive made on the day the the page was re-found</a>.
