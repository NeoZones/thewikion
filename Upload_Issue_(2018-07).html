On 2018-07-25, Neocities had an upload issue that effected a lot of users on the host. Users could not update items or even save their website, instead if a user tried to save their work, a pop up would appear by the save icon with a long and confusing error message.
<p>
This error lasted around from 13:00 UCT until around 21:00 UCT, on the same day when the Neocities Twitter account would post this message;
<blockquote> <tt>We had an upload issue this morning related to a hard disk failure, but things should be recovering now. If you are still having issues saving changes, please let us know.</tt></blockquote> 
<p>
Despite this, very few members could update their website, they could make a new file via the browser dashboard, but not edit it.
<p>
The issue would be fixed one day later on the 26th at around 00:46 UCT.
<tt><blockquote>Update: We fixed another issue that was preventing file saves for certain sites. Saving should be working again for all sites.</tt></blockquote>
