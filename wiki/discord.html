<h3>This article is outdated.</h3>
<p>
Since this article was last updated in September 2018, there have seen a number of new servers made. They should be added. A list of all known servers can be found <a href="https://cd5k.net/discord/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
<a href="https://discordapp.com" target="_blank">Discord</A> is a freeware VoIP application that in 2015 was designed for gaming communities. Discord can run on a number of platforms, such as Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, and in web browsers as well as Android and iOS. As of December 2017, there were about 87 million unique users of the software.
<p>
Unlike a lot of VoIPs such as Skype, TeamSpeak, Ventrilo and Mumble, Discord is free and easy to set up and quick to understand to a new user, because of this - <i>and their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZOaLXfjnAM" target="_blank">unique branding</a></i> - they have grown to become very popular online, including on Neocities.
<p>
A number of public Discord servers for Neocities have been made during the years.
<p>
<b><h1><a href="#The unofficial Neocities' Discord">The unofficial Neocities' Discord</a><a name="The unofficial Neocities' Discord"></a></h1></b>
<p>
The unofficial Neocities' Discord is perhaps one of the most well-known Discord servers on Neocities. It was first set-up by <a href="https://rocketmix.neocities.org" target="_blank">Rocketmix</A> on the 31st of July 2016 and since then it has grown to have 170+ members.
<p>
The server has two moderators, of which one is mostly inactive, and a large amount of text channels regarding different topics.
<p>
The server can be joined by following this URL: <a href="https://discord.gg/GpnED8V" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/GpnED8V</a>
<p>
<b><h1><a href="#The People's Republic of OwlMania&#x2122; Discord Server">The People's Republic of OwlMania&#x2122; Discord Server</a><a name="The People's Republic of OwlMania&#x2122; Discord Server"></a></h1></b>
<p>
The OwlMania Discord Server was set-up by <a hre="https://owlman.neocities.org" target="_blank">OwlMan</A> in 2017 as a way for people to make fun of him. The server has 20+ people on it. The server is home of <a href="cuntyolk.html">Cunt Yolk</a>, <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/mslife/" target="_blank">MS Life</A>, and gay <a
href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#pr0n" target="_blank">pr0n</a>.
<p>
Server URL: <a href="https://discord.gg/jJWUXfB" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/jJWUXfB</a><br>
The server also has its own website: <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/odds/discord/" target="_blank">https://owlman.neocities.org/odds/discord/</a>
<p>
<b><h1><a href="#Jake's Discord Server">Jake's Discord Server</a> (dead)<a name="Jake's Discord Server"></a></h1></b>
<p>
The Jake's Discord Server was set-up by <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/odds/jake/" target="_blank">JakeOnline</A> for people to talk to him. Unlike most Neocities Discord servers, Jake's server had also been made for people on <a href="https://www.vidlii.com/" target="_blank">Vidlii</A>
<p>
Server URL: <a href="https://discord.gg/NCEbyX5" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/NCEbyX5</a> (dead link)<br>
The server also has a website: <a href="https://jakeonline.neocities.org/discord.html" target="_blank">https://jakeonline.neocities.org/discord.html</a> (dead link)
<p>
<b><h1><a href="#nocities">nocities</a> (dead)<a name="nocities"></a></h1></b>
<p>
If The unofficial Neocities' Discord is Reddit, then the <i>nocities</i>'s Discord server is 4chan, full of people who are pissed off for silly reasons.
<p>
Around the 13th of May 2018, RocketMix invited an auto-mod bot that he made called <i><a href="https://github.com/Jacklack3/boopie-" target="_blank">boopie</A></i>. Among other things the bot would do was remove invite links to other Discord servers, a small number of people did not like this and so yoshi295295  decided to make a new server at 17:41:43 GMT+0000 (UTC) just called <i>nocities</i>, soon after Mariteaux (an adult, remember that), became the owner of the server.
<p>
Here is a transcript about the new server in The unofficial Neocities' Discord;
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
[23:48] <font color="ff0080">OwlMan: lol, drama</font><br>
[23:48] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: it's not drama</font><br>
<i>[...]</i><br>
[23:48] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: we have concerns, and if you wanna laugh and feel smug on the sidelines, feel free to do so</font><br>
[23:48] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: we don't wanna be a part of this server anymore</font><br>
[23:48] <font color="ff0080">OwlMan: lol</font><br>
[23:48] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: we want someone to listen to us</font><br>
[23:48] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: so</font><br>
[23:48] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: why'd you join for the 4th time</font><br>
[23:49] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: simple as that</font><br>
[23:49] <font color="ff0080">OwlMan: He's 13, calm down</font><br>
[23:49] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: @OwlMan that much is obvious</font><br>
[23:49] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: are you owl man /s</font><br>
[23:49] <font color="ff0080">OwlMan: You called a 13-year-old a "fucking cuck", that would be like if I called JakeOnline a cunt</font><br>
[23:49] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: i dunno, is jakeonline a cunt?</font><br>
[23:49] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: never talked to him</font>
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
And here is a transcript that took place on the same day;
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
[23:41] <font color="597FFF">hosma: so all the fuss is over some bot as i understand?</font><br>
[23:41] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: no</font><br>
[23:41] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: the fuss is over way more</font><br>
[23:41] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: lpl</font><br>
<i>[...]</i><br>
[23:41] <font color="597FFF">hosma: what actually happened</font><br>
[23:41] <font color="FF4300">jcbug: It's a useless bot.</font><br>
[23:41] <font color="597FFF">hosma: "jack is incompetent" doesn't really answer anything</font><br>
[23:41] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: boopie is my bot</font><br>
[23:41] <font color="597FFF">hosma: that thing that never does anything?</font><br>
[23:41] <font color="00BBFF">Bobzilla: over multiple things but not listening to removing a bot cuz mari got muted for sending a discord lnk not removing channels that deserve to be there (site-help, site-feedback, and site-discussion)</font><br>
[23:41] <font color="277046">elementz: @hosma mari and some others are complaning how ignorant rocketmix is</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="597FFF">hosma: but why</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: @hosma as i explained previously, there've been a bunch of instances where multiple people have tried to get rocketmix to clean up useless bots, useless channels, useless roles, and all he's done is ignore his active users and make excuses</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: this isn't me vs rocketmix</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: other people have been with me as it happened</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: and they've been ignored too</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: so we left</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: no only you mari</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="FF4300">jcbug: Dude.</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: if that's what you wanna believe</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="FF4300">jcbug: I exist.</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: but i have logs</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: and other fucking people in this room</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: and this is what i mean about you being thick</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: people go with you yeah</font><br>
[23:42] <font color="FF4300">jcbug: Also three quarters of the people here.</font><br>
[23:43] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: but you start it</font><br>
[23:43] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: @rocketmix and why's that?</font><br>
[23:43] <font color="277046">elementz: that are active*</font><br>
[23:43] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: is it because</font><br>
[23:43] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: i'm right?</font><br>
[23:43] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: i have a point?</font><br>
<i>[...]</i><br>
[23:43] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: to you I guess</font><br>
[23:43] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: certainly not due to my charming personality or bubbly disposition</font><br>
[23:43] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: no, i think people agree with me</font><br>
[23:43] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: and you don't like that</font><br>
[23:43] <font color="277046">elementz: oof</font><br>
[23:43] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: so you choose to ignore that</font><br>
<i>[...]</i><br>
[23:45] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: i wouldn't</font><br>
[23:45] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: I would</font><br>
[23:45] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: cool story</font><br>
[23:45] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: so which is it</font><br>
[23:45] <font color="277046">elementz: @rocketmix do u agree to my statement</font><br>
[23:45] <font color="277046">elementz: ?</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: are you here to fix shit or are you here to argue</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: if it's the latter, you can fuck off out of our server, we're done with you</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="FF4300">jcbug: @rocketmix  Please be here to fix shit.</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: one of your friends posted a link to a reddit post of a bot that got hacked and deleted message</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: i don't care</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="277046">elementz: so?</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: that's not an answer</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: Nd people were mad</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: are you here to fix shit or are you gonna argue more</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="ff0080">OwlMan: So, who's the better band; Judas Priest or Saxon? I think Saxon as they have more of a up beat way of singing, but they also cover issues such as death and war. But saying that, Judas Priest are pretty good too, for one Rob can really fucking hold a note, like Jesus Christ is is epic. At the end of the day, I like both bands, but I like Saxon just a little bit more.</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: so lmao</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="FF4300">jcbug: @OwlMan  No idea who they are.</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: @rocketmix so the latter then?</font><br>
[23:46] <font color="597FFF">hosma: saxon by far</font><br>
[23:47] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: ?</font><br>
[23:47] <font color="277046">elementz: @OwlMan i like how u just switch the topic to something else</font><br>
[23:47] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: are you here to fix shit or are you gonna argue more</font><br>
[23:47] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: i've asked this three times now</font><br>
[23:47] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: keep up</font><br>
[23:47] <font color="FF7C00">rocketmix: argue more I guess</font><br>
[23:47] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: then fuck off</font><br>
[23:47] <font color="734F96">Mariteaux: we don't want you</font><br>
[23:47] <font color="277046">elementz: ok wait hold up</font><br>

Sometime in 2016, now-ex-Neocities user b1tchduck made a Discord server, not much is known about it apart from that some now-ex-<a href="networkneighborhood.html">Network Neighborhood</a> members used it, apart from that the server is now lost in time.

CyberLounge was also the name of an IRC that was ran by the NN, however it was "phased out due to inactivity" and was replaced by the Discord server.
