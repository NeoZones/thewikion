<h1>Capy Comics</h1>
<p><i><tt>Also see <a href="ms_life.html">MS Life</a>, a comic Capy helped work on.</tt></i></p>
<p><i>Capy Comics</i> is the given name to a number of <a href="webcomics_on_neocities.html">WebComics</A> written, drawn, and published by Welsh Neocities user <a href="https://gwtagacw.neocities.org" target="_blank">Capy</A>. Despite Capy being represented by her <a href="https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Fursona" target="_lank">fursona</a> (a capybara), the comics deal with slice of life events, along with real world events such as with <a href="https://gwtagacw.neocities.org/capy/10.html" target="_blank">comic #10</a> that is about a minor earthquake that affected parts of Wales and England at the time. The comic doesn't have a set schedule and instead acts as a diary of sorts.</p>
