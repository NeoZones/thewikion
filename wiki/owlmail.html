<h1>OwlMail</h1>
<p>
<i><a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/owlmail/">OwlMail</A></i> is a newsletter from Clive Python (who also goes by "OwlMan") that covers many subjects such as <a href="https://sonichu.com/cwcki">Christine Weston Chandler</A>, metal music, ASCII art, and movies.
<p>
OwlMail first came-out in July 2017 with Issue I, "<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/owlmail/1.htm">Same Old Crap, Ripping off b3ta!</a>". So far there have been 9 issues of the newsletter published online.

In the first issue of OwlMail published on the 3rd of July 2017, OwlMan talks about the <a href="general election">2017 UK general election</A>, in which current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)">Conservative</A> Prime Minister Theresa May kept her seat as PM. In this issue, OwlMan writes;
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
Nothing is going to change really, the only new thing is that there are more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)">Labour</A> members in parliament, so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> better do his best!
<p>
One of the best things that happened in the General Election is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Independence_Party">UKIP</A> got FuCkInG KiLlEd, not only did they get zero seats in parliament, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nuttall">Paul Nuttall</A> resigned! GET WRECKED!
<p>
This was also the first time that I was legally allowed to vote in the General Election, and damn, I voted so hard that I popped a blood vessel and nearly broke a rib. I'll let you guess who I voted for.

So, what has been going on since my last post? 
<p>
Not much really, I'm just posting this to say that I'm sick, oh boy! I went and saw my local GP this week (Save the NHS!) to see what was wrong with me and as it turns out, I have tonsillitis (that is to say an oral infection of a sort), so I'm taking paracetamol like, four times a day, so cool cool! All I've been able to drink is Coca-Cola, like, thank God for Capitalism. I'm sounding like an american again, aren't I?

<h2>OwlMail No. VII: Into The Jaws of Defeat</h2>
<p>
Published on the 18th of May 2018, OwlMail VII is about the recent news that Christine Weston Chandler had came-out as bisexual, something OwlMan (an open bisexual male) pointed out as quite weird, he writes;
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
So over the years, CWC has been less than tolerant towards "<a href="https://sonichu.com/cwcki/Homos">the homos</A>" saying (dumb) shit such as:
<p>
"Yes, I am a homophobe; I fear them all, and I fear the tormenting temptations of falling off the straight path. But then I mentally, sometimes from a DVD (and if you'll pardon the expression), shove some pussy in my face. I tell you what, if I ever stoop down to changing my path, I might as well would get a gender change operation."
<p>
But as it turns out, in April 2018 Chandler came out as <a href="https://sonichu.com/cwcki/Chris_and_sexuality#Bisexuality">bisexual</A> and as of writing is now in a <a href="https://sonichu.com/cwcki/Cryzel_and_Magi-Chan">polyamorous relationship with two other people</A>. First off, holy shit, nice one there CWC, not only getting pussy but also dick, like damn son, you're on a role there, fam! Second, I find it really funny that someone who less than ten years ago was probably one of the most homophobic people around[.]
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
OwlMan also talks about his disappointment with VidLii;
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
[Around] mid-April early May 2018, a mod on the site, AliTheZombie13 (nice fucking username), started to b&#x26; a large number of users on the site and even (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180511000822/https://jakeonline.neocities.org/blog.html">according to JakeOnline</A>) leaked a users IP, leaked his email, and then banned him from the site just because they didn&#x27;t like him.
<p>
I don&#x27;t know about you, but if this is true (I doubt it&#x27;s made-up) then this really paints VidLii in a very bad light and as a shitty website ran
by people who don&#x27;t care about their users at all, why the <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/S/sysop.html">sysop</A> didn&#x27;t do anything about a mod <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing">doxxing</A> users, I have no idea at all, if I was the one running the site, I would have b&#x26; AliTheZombie13 from the website forever and made a public apology.
<p>
But, to be fair, AliTheZombie13 is no longer a mod on the site and was replaced by VidLii&#x27;s only real known-face, a user called AM.
<p>
After this, can I recommend the site to anyone? No, I do think I can at all - and that&#x27;s a real shame too, VidLii has a diverse community of people making videos just because it&#x27;s fun and not for the money, but after this, I would stay far away from the website.

<h2>OwlMail No. VIII: Soldier of Fortune</h2>
<p>
This issue of OwlMail was made on the 26th of May 2018. This issue heavily divots a large portion to talking about Christine Weston Chandler, and has a part of the issue named "BEST OF CWC" where OwlMan talks about the more notable parts of Chandler's life, such as <a href="https://sonichu.com/cwcki/Prank_calls">prank calls</A>, <a href="https://sonichu.com/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG">ShecameforCWC.JPG</A>, and <a href="https://sonichu.com/cwcki/ECV_00002">ECV 00002</a>.
<p>
Apart from Christine Weston Chandler, OwlMan also made a part of the issue called <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/owlmail/8.htm#whatpeopleonneocitieshavemade">What People on Neocities Have Made</a>, where he talks about a new <a href="cuntyolk.html">Cunt Yolk</A> song. He also talks about JakeOnline's new newsletter, <i><a href="hot_garbage_newsletter.html">Hot Garbage Newsletter</a></i>;
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
[Recently], the OwlMail newsletter came back to life, like a zombie or Jesus, and Jake of JakeOnline seems to have liked the idea, so he made his own newsletter...again...
<p>
You might be thinking to yourself, "why are you seemly okay with Jake using your idea" - well you should see what the title for OwlMail #1 was, also he's like 13, why would I be pissed off at a 13-year-old?
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
The title is a references to the Saxon song <i>Power And The Glory</i>, where the first line is "I'm a soldier of fortune I'm trained and I'm ready to kill".
