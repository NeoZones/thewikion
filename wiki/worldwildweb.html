<h1>WorldWildWeb</h1>
<p>
WorldWildWeb was a website that was first came into the known in October 2017 on the <a href="halloweenjam.html">HalloweenJam website</A>. The site was a webhost for people to use rather than Neocities, but saying that, the site did link Neocities and say on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170904064906/http://wild.webs.vc/faq.htm">Frequently Asked Questions part of the site</A> that you should try "both webhosts and see which suits you".
<p>
Unlike Neocities you didn't need to become a <a href="supporter.html">supporter</a> of the host to upload ZIP files and there were no filetype restrictions, along with this you could create unlimited websites.
<p>
Sometime around late October 2017 the website went offline. Sadly the website only had two archives made of it, the first being the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170904064156/http://wild.webs.vc/index.html">landing page</a> and the second being the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170904064906/http://wild.webs.vc/faq.htm">FAQ page</A>.
<p>
In February 2018, OwlMan posted this on his profile, asking about the webhost;
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
<font color="ff0080">OwlMan: Anyone have any idea what happened/what was WorldWildWeb (<a href="http://wild.webs.vc/">http://wild.webs.vc/</a>)?</font color>
<p>
<font color="0000ff">FloppyJay: I was the creator. I figured out a way to set up a server from an old, seemingly useless computer, set up port forwarding and built a very small 'anarchist's webhost' using php. It was named WorldWildWeb because I barely put any limitation on there as an advantage over neocities, besides a 30mb upload limit. The project was very hastily thrown together, essentially as a proof of concept. It needed a lot more work.</font color>
<p>
<font color="0000ff">FloppyJay: I saw the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lemmy-02.jpg">Motorhead picture</A> you uploaded iirc</font color>
<p>
<font color="ff0080">OwlMan: So will it ever come back? Or is it now lost to time? Also Lemmy bless</font color>
<p>
<font color="0000ff">FloppyJay: When I have an overage of freetime, it just might return.</font color>
<p>
<font color="B200FF">The Fun Zone: I saw it disappeared too. I had intended on making a very small private website on it and just updating it from time to time. Floppyjay I think it would be fantastic if you brought it back, there was a magic to that service that Neocities just cannot replace</font color>
<p>
<font color="1C6989">joppiesaus: Whoa! I missed this entirely! It seems pretty cool and awesome!(and also dangerous lol) awesome stuff</font color>
