<p>
<i>Cappy Comics</i> is the given name to a number of <a href="webcomics_on_neocities.html">WebComics</A> written, drawn, and published by Welsh Neocities user <a href="https://gwtagacw.neocities.org">Cappy</A>. Despite Cappy being represented by her <a href="https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Fursona">fursona</a> (a guinea pig), the comics deal with slice of life events, along with real world events such as with <a href="https://gwtagacw.neocities.org/capy/10.html">comic #10</a> that is about a minor earthquake that affected parts of Wales and England at the time.
