WebComics are comics that are published on the Web or on a mobile app. Some well-known WebComics are <a href="http://explosm.net/comics/latest">Cyanide &#x26; Happiness</A>, <a href="http://www.loadingartist.com/">Loading Artist</A>, <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</A>, and <a href="http://extrafabulouscomics.com/">Extra Fabulous Comics</A>.
<p>
The large majority of WebComics on Neocities are self-published, that is to say that there is no large involvement of any kind from an established publisher. A number of people have published their comics on Neocities, all adding their own style of writing, humour, and art style.
