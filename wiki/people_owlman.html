<p>
Clive Python has been running his <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/">owlman.neocities.org</A> website since early 2016. The site is home to his <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/">articles</A>, <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/vid/">his videos</A>, and <a href="owlmail.html">his newsletter</A>.
<p>
Along with Neocities, OwlMan is also very active on <a href="archive_org.html">The Internet Archive</A>, where he tries to archive as much of the Web as he can, he has also <a href="https://archive.org/details/owlman.neocities.org_10.01.2017">archived his whole site on there</A>. OwlMan can be very outspoken on archiving the Web that fellow Neocities user, Strata, asked him if "Is it possible that you have an archival fetish?" as a joke.
<p>
Some of his favourite things apart from Neocities is ASCII art, playing <a href="doom.html">Doom WADs</a>, and playing heavy metal music like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxon_(band)">Saxon</A>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mot%C3%B6rhead">Mot&#xF6;rhead</A>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Priest">Judas Priest</A>.
<p>
He also runs his own Discord server, <a href="discord.html#The People's Republic of OwlMania&#x2122; Discord Server">The People&#x27;s Republic of OwlMania&#x2122; Discord Server</a>, that was one of the birth places of <a href="cuntyolk.html">Cunt Yolk</A> - a band he has helped in the past. OwlMan also made the infamous <a href="cat_pr0n.html">"Cat Pr0n" drawing</A>.
<p>
OwlMan has been apart of some noticeable events on Neocities, such as help make <a href="ms_life.html">MS Life</a>, being of of only two people to take part in <a href="halloweenjam.html">SpookyJay's WebsiteJam</A>, and his <a href="networkneighborhood.html#OwlMan Quitting Neocities">"I'm Quitting Neocities" blog post, making fun of the Network Neighborhood</A>.
