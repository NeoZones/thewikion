A command-line interface or command language interpreter (CLI), also known as command-line user interface, console user interface, and character user interface (CUI), is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines). A program which handles the interface is called a command language interpreter or shell (computing).</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://neocities.org/cli">Neocities CLI</a> is a utility written in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank">Ruby programming language</A> to interface with the Neocities API from a terminal. It allows a website to be managed entirely through the console, without the use of a web browser.</p>
<p>
<h2><a href="#Installation">Installation</a><a name="Installation"></a></h2>
The Neocities CLI runs on any platform with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/" target="_blank">Ruby, and its Gem package manager</a> installed. Run <tt>gem install neocities</tt> and it will install.</p>
<p>
In the case of macOS or Linux users, the page on Neocities' website advises to run it with <tt>sudo</tt> if there are permissions issues. If the installation has an error about <tt>rake</tt> not being installed, run <tt>gem install rake</tt> before trying again.</p>
<h2><a href="#Usage">Usage</a><a name="Usage"></a></h2>
<p>
Using any of the Neocities CLI's functions will prompt you to enter your site's username and password. After this, it will store the API key and you won't need to enter it again.</p>
<p>
A full list of the CLI's functions can be found by just typing <tt>neocities</tt> into the terminal.</p>
<p>
If you have an existing site, you may want to download and extract it first through the Neocities dashboard, so you can jump into editing right away.</p>
<p>
You can push the entire directory to your site by going to the folder and running <tt>neocities push .</tt>.</p>
<p>
Additionally, you can upload files (<tt>neocities upload</tt>), delete files (<tt>neocities delete</tt>), list your files (<tt>neocities list</tt>), get stats (<tt>neocities info</tt>), or log out (<tt>neocities logout</tt>).</p>
