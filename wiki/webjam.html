A second WebJam seems to <a href="https://hyperlink.neocities.org/hyperjam/" target="_blank">have been made for August 2018</A>, this needs to be added to this article.<p>

<i>This is for the article on <a href="webjam.html">WebJam</a> If you are looking for the article on HyperJam, <a href="hyperjam.html">go here.</a> <br> If you were looking for the article on SpookyJay's WebsiteJam, <a href="halloweenjam.html">go here</a>.</i> <br><br>

WebJam was a failed attempt by <a href="neo404.html#Wizard Cat">Wizard Cat</a> (Now known as Bobzilla), Project2 and Rocketmix to start up a weekly site-making competition. So far there have been zero competitions, there was <a href="halloweenjam.html">SpookyJay's WebsiteJam</A> but that was by FloppyJay and not really associated with WebJam.

<p>
The idea of a site-making competition was floating around at least since late August 2017, as seen in <i><a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/neomail/neomail_summer_4_web_1_0_awards.html">NeoMail Summer #4 - Web 1.0 Awards?</a></i> when Melonking says that Neocities "needs <i>[...]</i> some sort of award. Something that is handed out yearly in a number of categories, like Best CSS work, Most Unique Idea, etc.", OwlMan would reply to the E-Mail by saying;
<p>
<blockquote><tt>
I like the sound of that, infact, only the other day I was talking to Jakeonline (Design Choices) about the same thing and how good it would be to do something like that, I would love to see something like this on Neocities! 
</blockquote></tt>
<p>
The idea of WebJam was first made public by Project2 in September 2017, when they posted on their profile asking if people would be interested in a weekly site-making competition.
<p>
The WebJam website was made on the 23rd of September 2017 where it has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926014407/https://webjam.neocities.org/">sleeping robot on</A>. The site was updated later to make <A href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171001020830/https://webjam.neocities.org/">the robot bigger</A> and to advertise <a href="halloweenjam.html">SpookyJay's WebsiteJam</A>, but apart from that there were no other noticeable updates.
<p>
The site was last updated on the First of October 2017.
