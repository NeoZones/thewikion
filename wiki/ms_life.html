On Easter Sunday 2018, OwlMan made a new channel on <a href="discord.html#The People's Republic of OwlMania&#x2122; Discord Server">his Discord server</A> called #ms-life. Simply put, MS Life was an interactive MS Paint story where people came up with the plot of the story, while OwlMan would draw the pictures for the viewer.

The plot of MS Life is quite bizarre and nonsensical at times. The plot follows an unnamed stickman who meets up with his boyfriend to visit the Moon.

While OwlMan made a lot of the artwork in the <a href="webcomics_on_neocities.html">comic</A>, three other people are credited as the co-creators; Hosma is credited as to help make the story, Cappy (who is called by her alt-name "Gwta") is credited as helping make the story and artwork, and finally Strata is credited as to helping make the story and end card.
