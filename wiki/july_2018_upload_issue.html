<p>On the 25th of July 2018, Neocities had an upload issue that effected a lot of users on the host. Users could not update items, or even save their website.</p>
<p>If a user tried to save their work, a pop up would appear by the save icon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neocities/comments/91rvqi/new_neocities_error/" target="_blank">with a long and confusing error message</A>.</p>
<p>This error lasted around from 13:00 UCT until around 21:00 UCT on the same day when the Neocities Twitter account would post this message;</p>
<tt>
We had an upload issue this morning related to a hard disk failure, but things should be recovering now. If you are still having issues saving changes, please let us know.
</tt>
<p>Despite this, very few members could update their website, they could make a new file via the browser dashboard, but not edit it.</p>
<p>The issue would be fixed one day later on the 26th at around 00:46 UCT.</p>
<tt>
Update: We fixed another issue that was preventing file saves for certain sites. Saving should be working again for all sites.
