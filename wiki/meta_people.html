Have you made edits to <a href="meta_about.html">Penny's Place</A>? Do you want a article made on yourself? Do you think that an article should be written on someone?
<p>
If your answer to any of the questions was "yes", then you might like to <a href="meta_style.html#Public Information">write an article on yourself/subject</A>. For more, see <tt>#tbg</tt> on <a href="https://hyperlink.neocities.org/howtojoin/">the Hyperlink Discord</a> for more (note that you do not need to be a member of Hyperlink to view this channel).</p>

<p>
Articles on people can be quite a hard thing to do, as, while you want to show information relating to that person, you also don't want to harm their public image, that's why whenever a bio is made on a person it needs to be <a href="https://sonichu.com/cwcki/TRUE_and_HONEST">TRUE and HONEST</A>, plus in a balanced light.
<p>
Because of this bios on people will be made very sparingly and only made for people who have made a big impact on Neocities, or for people who are okay with having an article written on them.</p>
<p>
If you think that a bio is missing for a person, or you want to add a bio on yourself to be put on here, please <a href="meta_about.html#Contact Me">contact us</A>.</p>
