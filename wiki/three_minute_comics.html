Three Minute Comic (stylised as "THREE MINUTE COMICS") are a set of three <a href="webcomics_on_neocities.html">WebComics on Neocities</a> that date back from April 2016. Not much is known about the comics, or even who made them for that matter. The comics seem to be hand-drawn, and then photocopied on to a computer when they were then posted on <a href="https://3minutecomics.neocities.org">the Three Minute Comics website</A>.
<p>
The site has not been updated since April of 2016.
