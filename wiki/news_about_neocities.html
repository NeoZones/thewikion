<h1>News Reports About Neocities</h1>
<p>
Throughout most of the web-hosts life, Neocities has been the subject of journalism, a surprisingly a lot of this has not been done by amateur journalists, but has been done by large companies, like Wired, Vice, New York Times, and The Verge.
<p>


<h2>Neocities is recreating the garish, Web 1.0 creativity of GeoCities (1st/2nd of July 2013)</h2>
<p>
Very early report talking abut Neocities from American digital media and broadcasting company, Vice, who first reported on Neocities less than a month after the host went online. In the report by Meghan Neal, she talks about how "NeoCities aims to be something bigger than fuck-yeah-90s retro";
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
With 90s nostalgia at full throttle, it's no surprise to see the recent launch of NeoCities, a rebirth of the Dot Com-era web hosting platform Geocities, in all its flashy, neon, blinking, clip art-filled wonder. 
<p>
But NeoCities aims to be something bigger than fuck-yeah-90s retro. According to its creator Kyle Drake, a software engineer and self-proclaimed "professional cyberpunk," the project is a way to recreate not only the aesthetic of the early personal websites, but also the original mission of Geocities: to give anyone with internet access a free place on the web.
<p>
<i>[...]</i>
<p>
The way Drake sees it, today's internet culture is one of consumption, not creation. Sure, websites are now interactive, dynamic, highly functional, user-friendly and hypersocial. But at what cost? The web has become homogenous, controlled, even monitored—a "sad, pathetic digital iron curtain."
<p>
So NeoCities is a platform to simplify creation. Users get 10 MB of free webpage hosting and a bare bones interface to build from, with just HTML and images.  The goal is to be as uncensored, anonymous and open as possible. (Though uncensored may be a pipe dream; already the fuckthensa.neocities.org domain has been seized.)
<p>
In its first week, 1,600 sites were created—some straight 90s throwback, some delightfully random, some just ugly as hell.
