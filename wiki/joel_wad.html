joel.wad, also know as "Satan's Asshole" is a <a href="doom.html">Doom II WAD</A> that was made by RenderError for the <a href="http://vinesauce.com/">Vinesauce</A> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UlFPCsdiPk">Doom Contest II: Hellectric Boogaloo</A>.
<p>
<img src="img/doom_mapping_contest_ii.png" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
<p>
The WAD was played by the contest runner, Joel Johansson (better known as "Vargskelethor") on the 11th of April 2018.
<p>
Joel commented on the WAD by saying that "this didn't weight so much, I figured it as like 'babies first Doom map', but it's not that bad".
<p>
In total the WAD is 840 KB (860,469 bytes), has 42 monsters, 1 secret, and 17 items. The WAD uses a MIDI version of Metallica's <i>Master Of Puppets</i>, from their third studio album, released in 1986 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_Records">Elektra Records</a>, along with <i>Master Of Puppets</i>, the WAD also uses a MIDI version of "The Thing That Should Not Be", also from 1986's Master Of Puppets album.
<p>
According to the game's <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Title_screen">title screen</a>, the WAD is called "Satan's Asshole" has nothing to do with anything, "Wad has nothing to do with satan or his asshole it's just that i cannot think of a name".
<p>
The WAD was made to be played in <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/QZDoom">QZDoom</a>, as it uses abilities that are not possible in the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_engine#Vanilla_Doom">vanilla</a> <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_engine">Doom engine</a> (like using room-over-room).
<p>
