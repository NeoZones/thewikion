Some people chose to make their E-Mail address public for other people to see, here are some ways you can format it.
<p>
Let's say that your E-Mail is "<tt>gtrix2@yahoo.com</tt>", but you don't want to get spam mail, some good ways to not get spam is make the address only readable by a human, so you might chooses to write your E-Mail as: "<tt>gtrix2 [at] yahoo dot com</tt>", "<tt>g t r i x 2 @ y a h o o . c o m</tt>", "<tt>gtrix2 //@// yahoo ///./// com</tt>", or any other way a bot might struggle to read.
<p>
<h2>Code</h2>
<p>
Displaying your address in plain text is okay, but using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URI scheme</A> can also be a benefit to some people, so that rather than copying your address entering it into an email client by hand, a person can just click the address and have it open in their client.
<p>
<i>Some examples:</i>
<p>
Using "mailto" within an HTML document to generate a link for sending email:
<p>
<tt>&#x3C;a href=&#x22;mailto:gtrix2@yahoo.com&#x22;&#x3E;Send me an email!&#x3C;/a&#x3E;
<p>
What you see: <a href="mailto:gtrix2@yahoo.com">Send me an email!</a>
<p>
Of course, you could also use the tips at the top to stop spam bots from mailing you!
