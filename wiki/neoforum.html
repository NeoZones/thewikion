<h1>NeoForums</h1>
<p>
From the 26th of August 2015, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207205449/http://neoforum.icyboards.net/">NeoForums</A> (or "neoforums") was an online forum for fellow Neocities users to join and talk about a number of subjects including music, games, help with code, showcasing your site and other subjects.<img src="img/neoforum.png" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
<p>
The forum ran under <a href="https://mybb.com/">MyBB</a> (formerly known as "MyBBoard" and originally "MyBulletinBoard") a free and open source forum software developed by the MyBB Group.
<p>
In its lifetime, the forum had up to 44 members, total of 2,591 posts in 38 threads and the most users online at one time was 76 on the 12th of October 2016 at 10:50 AM.
<p>
NeoForums shut down sometime around December 2017.
<p>
In December 2017, OwlMan made <a href="https://neocities.org/site/owlman?event_id=516956">a post on his profile</A> saying asking about the forum;
<p>
<blockquote><tt>
<font color="#ff0080">OwlMan: Am I right in saying that there was a Neocities' forum? I think it was set up by FloppyJay, I might be wrong.</font color>
<p>
<font color="#a349a4">2bit: Idk if this is it, but i tried making one and it was linked with another website I made. No one really used it and I think it's owfilled with spambots.</font color>
<p>
<font color="#0000ff">FloppyJay: We're all talking about the same one, I was co-admin, 2bit was the founder and it was linked on the front of FloppyJay. It's in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904111738/http://floppyjay.neocities.org:80/">the web archives too</A>, and yes, it was almost entirely spambots upon revisiting.</font color>
</blockquote></tt>
<p>
It is important to remember that NeoForums was never really well known on Necities and not many people knew about it at all, along with this, in July 2016 <a href="discord.html#The unofficial Neocities' Discord">The unofficial Neocities' Discord</A> was made, it was the final blow for the forum, making it pointless to join. This and the spam is why it was shut-down.
