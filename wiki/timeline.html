<p>
<b>27 May</b></br>
For some reason, Mariteaux makes a new Neocities Doscord server called "<a href="https://discord.gg/WXqn2br">Neocities 2.0</A>", the server was made so there would be "No overhead, no busybody mods, no drama, none of that. We started this to get away from all that. As long as you're not being obnoxious or doing something illegal, come as you are". The server would later be called "Penelope's Place" after the Necities' mascot of the same name. Also on this day the old nocities server was removed.
