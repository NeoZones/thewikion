<h1>The Hot Garbage Newsletter</h1>
<p>
<i><tt>Also see <a href="owlmail.html">OwlMail</a>, a newsletter that Jake was inspired by.</tt></i>
<p>
After JakeOnline's first newsletter faded away, Jake made a second newsletter entitled as <i>The Hot Garbage Newsletter</i>. Unlike his <a href="jakeonline_weekly_newsletter.html">first newsletter</a>, there would only be one issue from this newsletter.
<p>
In the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180519151321/https://jakeonline.neocities.org/garbage/newsletter/5-19-2018.html">only issue</a> from the newsletter, Jake talks about such subjects as VidLii, the <a href="cuntyolk.html">Cunt Yolk song "The Crazy Cunt (ft. Clive Python)"</a>, along with calling the newsletter "the second worst newsletter ever, first being <a href="owlmail.html">OwlMail</A>".
<p>
The newsletter was made as Jake "was looking at past archives of [his] site, trying to find [his] old newsletter. After an hour of searching through old web designs that [he] wished [he] kept, [Jake] found an archive. It turns out [Jake] want[s] a newsletter again".
