<h1>META: About Penny's Place</h1>
<p>In 2018, long time a <a href="neocities_org.html">Neocities</a> member came up with the idea of a wiki like website that was all about Neocities. The only problem was that to be a wiki other people needed to be able to edit the article on their browser, as <a href="people_owlman.html">OwlMan</A> planned on publishing this multi-article subsite on his own website (and that he did not plan on giving his password out), he could not call it a "wiki".</p>
<p>At the time, OwlMan had become quite the fan of the BBC Radio 2's <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blagger's_Guide" target="_blank">The Blagger's Guide</A></em>, a series of comical documentaries on specific music genres, and people. And so now this <em>multi-article subsite</em> thing had a name; The Blagger's Guide to The Culture of Neocities.</p>

<p>OwlMan had been working on this idea for a few months until July 2018 when he became a new member of <a href="webring.html#Hyperlink">Hyperlink</a>, a website on Neocities where a number of people have their own subsite.</p>
<p>Because of this new event, this means that more than one person could work on the site, and that people could work on this project via their browser... like a wiki.</p>
<p>The project would to be renamed to <b>Penny's Pages</b> less than two days after it was uploaded to Hyperlink.</p>
<p><em>Penny's Pages</em> is an ongoing project by a large number of people who not only use Neocites, but love, and use it most days. All of the text, images, and anything else <a href="meta_copyright.html">may be used by anyone</a> for free. This is a passion project that aims to inform not only new people to Neocities, but also want to inform older users of events, people, and history of a little webhost.</p>
