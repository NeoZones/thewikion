The Web is made out of HTML.
<p>
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language is a markup language that is used for making webpages such as this one you're viewing right now. HTML is used for putting in written text, links, photos, and sound and video. HTML is used to mark and describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can show them correctly.
<p>
A lot of the time people like to add Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript to their HTML code. CSS is used to change the way a page will look to the viewer, while JavaScript is used to add features to webpages and make them more interactive.
