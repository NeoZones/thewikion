<h1>robots.txt</h1>
<p>
Simply put, the robots exclusion standard (also called the robots exclusion protocol or robots.txt protocol) is a easy way of telling Web crawlers and other Web robots what parts of a Web site they can and can not view.
<p>
To give robots instructions about what part of your site they can access, you can put a text (.txt) file called robots.txt in the main directory of their Web site, e.g. <tt><a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/robots.txt">https://owlman.neocities.org/robots.txt</a></tt>. This file tells robots what part of your site they can view, however, some robots can ignore such files, especially malicious (or bad) robots.
<p>
If the robots.txt file does not exist, Web robots assume that they can see all parts of your site.
<p>
An example of a good robot (and a good boy).
