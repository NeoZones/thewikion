<h1>Cat Pr0n</h1>
<p>The Neocities "Cat Pr0n" drawing refers to a pornographic drawing OwlMan made that shows <a href="penelope.html">Penelope</a>, Neocities' mascot, in an erotic situation.</p>
<p>In the drawing, it shows Penelope standing up, with an erect penis (despite being a female cat), while she is next to a computer that shows the dashboard of <a href="https://neocities.org/site/kratzen" target="_blank">Kratzen</a>.</p>
<center><img src="img/cat_pr0n.png"></center>
<h2>The Competition</h2>
<p>So far the uncensored version has not been released by OwlMan, however, he decided than rather publishing the art, he would set up a competition for people to find it. So far no-one has found the uncensored photo.</p>
<p>OwlMan has given out five clues to where you can find the photo;</p>
<tt><blockquote>
1. You will need to look back in the past, to find the shitty photos, that suck ass
<br>
2. This has nothing to do with anything at all, do not fall for my trap <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/odds/cat/unknown.png" target="_blank">https://owlman.neocities.org/odds/cat/unknown.png</a>
<br>
3. You are looking for something colourful
<br>
4. .com
<br>
5. It's not on <a href="http://owlman.neocities.org/14jammar/" target="_blank">/14jammar/</A>
</tt></blockquote>
<p>Along with the five clues, OwlMan said that if 50 people liked the post he made that says "<a href="https://neocities.org/site/owlman?event_id=515297" target="_blank">Like this post if you love minions</a>", he would then link to the photo.</p>
<h2>Public Photos</h2>
<p>So far there have been a number of photo relating to the pr0n made public by OwlMan, all of the photos can be found on at <tt><a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/odds/cat/" target="_blank">https://owlman.neocities.org/odds/cat/</a></tt>.</p>
Along with the photos there exists the <a href="html.html">HTML</A> file, <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/odds/cat/clue.html" target="_blank">clue.html</A> that show all the clues.
<p>By going to <tt><a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/odds/cat/" target="_blank">/odds/cat/</a></tt> you will also be able to find <tt><a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/odds/cat/edit/" target="_blank">/odds/cat/edit/</a></tt> that, among other things, shows <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/odds/cat/edit/2.png" target="_blank">this photo</a> that uses a version of the censored cat pr0n. The photo was used on <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/owlmail/9.htm#dumbeditsofpenelope" target="_blank">OwlMail No. IX</A>.
<h2>Kyle Drake Finds Out</h2>
<p>It would seem that Kyle Drake was first made aware of the drawing on the <a href="neocities_irc.html">Neocities IRC</A> on the 11th of June 2018 by Neocities' user jackomix (Who runs <a href="discord.html#The unofficial Neocities' Discord">The unofficial Neocities' Discord Server</a>).</p>
