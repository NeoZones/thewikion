<h1>New Ownership of The OpenBooks Website</h1>
<p>
On the 29th of September 2017, Marin Exley (former <a href="networkneighborhood.html">Network Neighborhood</a> member), would change their website URL from <a href="https://openbooks.neocities.org"><tt>https://openbooks.neocities.org</tt></a> to <a href="https://teal.neocities.org"><tt>https://teal.neocities.org</tt></a> for an unknown reason.
<p>
In the process of changing their URL, hosma would take the URL for himself on the very same day. hosma would make a number of edits to the website, most of them being jabs at Marin Exley.
<p>
A number of <a href="archive_org.html">archives</A> to the site were made, and <a href="https://openboox.neocities.org/old">can still be seen</a> to this day.
<p>
<h1><a href="#15th of August 2017 @ 04:20:39">15th of August 2017 @ 04:20:39</a><a name="15th of August 2017 @ 04:20:39"></a></h1>
<p>
The 15th of August was noted as the very last time an archive was made on the OpenBooks website before hosma took over. In the time between the 15th of August and the 29th of September, little to no updates to the website was made by Marin.
<p>
The archive can be found here;
<p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170815042039/https://openbooks.neocities.org/">https://web.archive.org/web/20170815042039/https://openbooks.neocities.org/</a>
<p>
<h1><a href="#29th of September 2017 @ 22:18:26">29th of September 2017 @ 22:18:26</a><a name="29th of September 2017 @ 22:18:26"></a></h1>
<P>
This is the first archive of the OpenBooks website after hosma took over from Marin.
<p>
The title of the page reads as "I'm gay", the background is of a literal open book. By viewing the source code of the page, you can see that hosma left a message for fellow Neocities member <a href="people_owlman.html">OwlMan</A>;
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
FUCK YOU OWLMAN DON'T ARCHIVE THIS XD
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
OwlMan would archive the website anyway.
<p>
Also by viewing the source code, you can see that the video "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5zQTmkY7GI">10 Hours of Soviet Communist Music</a>" was supposed to play, although the video could only be played on YouTube due to a claim by WMG. This claim has since been removed.
<p>
