HyperJam is the name of a currently ongoing webjam that was first started by Bobzilla (Wizard Cat) in August of 2018. The theme for the webjam was that of an alternate history.
<p>
On the official webpage for the webjam it gives the example of "What if Abraham Lincoln never existed? What if Germany won World War 2?? What if the internet never existed?".</p>
<p>
This is so far the second time that there has been a webjam hosted on Neocities, the first time was in October 2017, with <em><a href="https://hyperlink.neocities.org/wiki/halloweenjam.html">SpookyJay's WebsiteJam</a></em>.</p>

<p>
It should also be noted that this is not the first time that Bobzilla was apart of a webjam, the first was simply known as "<a href="https://hyperlink.neocities.org/wiki/webjam.html">WebJam</A>", however, it never took off.
