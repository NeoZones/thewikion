<h1>Music on Neocities</h1>
<p>Music is perhaps one of the most important art forms. Not only does the type of music you enjoy define your character, but it can also strike a number of emotions and be divided into very wide range of genres and even more subgenres such as metal, rock, classical, pop, electronic, jazz, blues, avant-garde etc. and fusions of these. </p>
