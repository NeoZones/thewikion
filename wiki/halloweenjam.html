<h1>SpookyJay's WebsiteJam</h1>
<p>
The SpookyJay's WebsiteJam (also known as "HalloweenJam" and "FloppyJay HalloweenJam") could been seen as somewhat of a pilot for the unsuccessful <a href="webjam.html">WebJam</A>. Just like WebJam, HalloweenJam was a site-making competition, but unlike WebJam it was successful - somewhat. In total only two people took part in the competition; OwlMan with <i><a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/webjam/halloweenjam2017/">The House</a></i> and <a href="https://upallnight.neocities.org">Up All Night</A> with <i><a href="https://thetapes.neocities.org/">The Tapes</a></i>.
<p>
To have joined the competition, you needed a "halloween oriented website" that needed to be made with a new Neocities account made in October or a <A href="worldwildweb.html">WorldWildWeb</A> account, you then needed to post the URL on the <a href="https://neocities.org/site/halloweenjam">HalloweenJam profile</A> so that people could vote on who they wanted to win.
<p>
In the end, OwlMan would take first place with 9 votes, while Up All Night would be second with only 2 points.
