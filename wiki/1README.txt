++THIS IS OUTDATED, AND IS FROM THE OLD WIKI++

Okay, I should be done now! From now on if someone wants to change the background colour/font/anything else, please go to style.css.

I've fixed some grammar and made some small changes and additions to a few pages but didn't realize there's a "last updated" thing so I didn't touch that, oopsie

If anyone has some free time and is a masochist, could PLEASE
1. Try to close some of the <p> tags
2. Add target="_blank" to all the <a> tags that link outside of /tbg/?

Also what does joel.wad have to do with Neocities?

Hey, Owlman, a couple things I want to point out about HTML to you;
1. <p> tags are not the same as <br> tags. You do not have to close <br> tags and </br> isn't correct. You HAVE to close <p> tags. This is HTML 101.
2. You don't have to close <hr> tags. It's not "<hr></hr>" it's just "<hr>". 
3. You don't put a <p> before a <h1> (<h2>, <h3>, etc) because they both do the same thing, except that the <h1> tag changes the font size. Adding a <p> tag before it just adds an unnecessary gap.
4. If you start with "<font color="black"> you only have to close that with </font>.
If you can't spot these mistakes yourself, just look in the html editor on the site, it will show a red cross next to every line you fuck up.
5. You don't need to put images in <p> tags.

Today I saw that the July 2018 upload issue artical (july_2018_upload_issue.html) had some artwork by fellow Neocities user, Nekojiru, I was unsure if we were able to use the artwork, as when I went on their website (https://nekojiru.neocities.org/) I couldn't find any licenses for their art. So what I did was that I PMed them on Discord to ask about our use of their art;

[15:05] OwlMan: Hi there, Nekojiru!

I'm OwlMan, and I help run Penny's Pages here on Neocities. It looks like someone had added your art on this page here: https://hyperlink.neocities.org/wiki/july_2018_upload_issue.html (more than one person can edit the site so it wasn't me), I just wanted to know if you were okay with us using your art?

If you are okay with us using it, what license is your art under? I looked on your site but I didn't find any license. On Penny's Pages we only want to use work with a Creative Commons license (or any license that allows other's to use your work)

If you don't want us using your art, or your art isn't under a CC license, please say so that I can remove the art!

[15:16] Nekojiru: Hello!

I assumed it might've been PotassiumMCR2 (or another user who was on their server) who uploaded my artwork to the page since I originally posted it to a small discord server they've made regarding the upload issue at Neocities

My artwork is currently not under any license that I know of, so unfortunately that means it might have to be removed from the page. However I do have the intention of uploading the drawing onto my own website.

[15:16] OwlMan: Alright, thank you anyway for your time!

[15:17] OwlMan: I mean, if you want you can always put that one image under a Creative Commons license, but of cause, only if you want

[15:22] Nekojiru: I think I'd willing to put the image under a creative commons license for the sake of preserving Neocities history. But any other artwork I upload onward is not meant to be redistributed without my acknowledgement

[15:23] OwlMan: Great, thank you very much for your time! (I also like your site)

[15:24] Nekojiru: No problem. (And thank you!)

So there we go, we're only allowed to use that one artwork by them, but no other art!
