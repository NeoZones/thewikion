<h3>This article has a lot of issues.</h3>
<p>
Some of the issues are; it's too small, and it has no reference at all. It would also be nice if this article had an image to go along with it.

Simply put, Reddit ("I read it on Reddit") is a social news aggregation website where people can summit a link, then people can upvote or downvote said link so that more or less people will see it respectably. On Reddit there are "subreddits", subreddits are like mini forums on any subject you can think of, some popular subreddits are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hmmm/">/r/hmmm</A> (for weird photos), <a href="https://reddit.com/r/pics">/r/pics</a> (for photos), and <a href="https://reddit.com/r/funny">/r/funny</a> (for funny jokes).
<p>
/r/neocities was first started in 2014 by somebody who calls themself "EngageChimpoutMode" (who last posted on Reddit in 2014), the subreddit also has two other moderators; Reddit users MangaCleaver, and kyledrake.
