When you first join Neocities, you will receive a welcome <a href="email.html">E-Mail</A> to inform you of the basics of the host, and to also check to see if you're a human/have a valid E-Mail.
<p>
Below is a copy of the welcome E-Mail, note that the text that is in <em>italics</em> would normally contain information about the user who just joined.
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
Subject: [Neocities] Welcome to Neocities!</br>
Sender: noreply@neocities.org
<p>
Hello <em>[user]</em>, and welcome to Neocities!
<p>
Neocities is a community for people that make web sites, and you're now a member!
<p>
Making your first (or your latest) web site is a powerful thing. Unlike traditional social networks where you have no control over how your content is displayed, here you can create any kind of site you want, fill it with the content that matters to you, and share that site with everyone in the world. All you have to do is give out your web site address ([your website].neocities.org) for people to see your creation!
<p>
Since you're new, we've put together a basic "hello world" page for you. Now all you need to do is login and edit your "index.html" file, and you're on your way to being a webmaster of your own site on the World Wide Web!
<p>
If you have any questions or comments, or just want to say hi, feel free to contact us at <a href="https://neocities.org/contact">https://neocities.org/contact</a>. You can also reach us on Twitter at @neocitiesweb. We're super busy, so we can't help you with everything, but if you have a problem or bug to report, we'll try our best to look into it.
<p>
From Penelope (the Neocities cat), the Neocities Team, and on behalf of all our sites, our very best wishes for you (and your awesome web site). We can't wait to see what it looks like!
<p>
Best,</br>
The Neocities Team
<p>
