IRC, or Internet Relay Chat, is a chat system located on the Internet. IRC allows people from anywhere in the world to talk to one another, on IRC you may also have a private chat system where you may directly message someone.</p>
<p>
The <em>Neocities Internet Relay Chat</em> is a chatroom just for Neocities. By going on the IRC, you may be able to talk to a number of people, including <a href="kyle_drake.html">Kyle Drake</A> (who is known as "<tt>kyledrake</tt>"), however, the IRC can be empty a lot of the time, barley getting over six users at one time. This is probably due to how many people use <a href="discord.html#The%20unofficial%20Neocities'%20Discord">The unofficial Neocities' Discord</A>, and that IRC as a whole is dropping in numbers.</p>
<p>
The server for the IRC is located on Freenode (formerly known as Open Projects Network).</p>
<p>
On the 11th of June 2018, Kyle Drake was asked about what he thinks about The unofficial Neocities' Discord server by its owner, jackomix (Rocketmix);</p>
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
