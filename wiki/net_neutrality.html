Net neutrality, also called network neutrality, Internet neutrality, or net equality, is the principle that broadband providers (people who you pay to give you access to the web; BT, Comcast, TalkTalk, Virgin etc) and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally. This means that there should not be any discriminating or charging differently by user, content viewed, what website you're on, what browser, platform, or anything like that.
<p>
Neocities have shown their support for this idea, for example, around December 2016 the US government were thinking of scrapping the law, so a lot of websites such as Reddit, GitHub, Twitter, <a href="discord.html">Discord</a>, Newgrounds and users of Neocities started to show their support for Net neutrality by encouraging their viewers to go to <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/">Battle for Net Neutrality</a> so that they can contact Congress to tell them to vote in favour of keeping Net neutrality.
