<i>The JakeOnline Weekly Newsletter</i> (also known simply as "TJOWNL"), was known as "The JakeOnline Monthly Weekly Newsletter") was an online newsletter written and published by JakeOnline in late September 2017. The newsletter covered a wide array of issues, including current events on Neocities, fan mail, and website of the week.
<p>
<h2>Issue #1 from 22nd of September 2017</h2>
<p>
In this first issue of the newsletter (that can be found via <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/junk/newsletter/9-22-17.html">the OwlMan archive</a>), Jake mostly covers private messages between a number of people. At the end of the newsletter Jake uses a quote from OwlMan;
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
"So do you want your eggs to just role around on the palate?"</br>
-OwlMan (2017)
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
In this quote, OwlMan (a Brit) is talking about his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/07/10/confused-brits-are-so-angry-with-americans-for-not-having-egg-cups-6768081/">surprise that eggcups are uncommon in America</A>.
<p>
<h2>Issue #2 from 30th of September 2017</h2>
<p>
In the second issue (available via <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/junk/newsletter/9-30-17.html">the OwlMan archive</a>), Jake talks about <a href="webring.html#Hyperlink">Hyperlink</a> (a webring he was apart of at the time but would leave sometime later), fan mail he got from Tomato Hentai, and he made <a href="neo404.html#OpenBooks">openbooks.neocities.org</a> the website for the week (the site at the time was owned by Hosma)
