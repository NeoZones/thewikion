<h1>FuckDad</h1>
<em>FuckDad</em> (a parody of the name "Fox Dad") is the given name to a collection of bizarre, random, and very queer <a href="webcomics_on_neocities.html">WebComics</A> made by Neocities user, <a href="people_owlman.html">OwlMan</a> that can be <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/fdad/" target="_blank">found on his website</A>.
<img src="img/fd_page_16.png" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
<p>
The WebComic uses assets, and artwork from a number of online comics, such as <a href="https://sonichu.com/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)" target="_blank">Sonichu</A>, <a href="http://shencomix.com" target="_blank">OwlTurd</A>, <a href="http://explosm.net" target="_blank">Cyanide &#x26; Happiness</A>, and numerous amounts of comics found from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ComedyCemetery/" target="_blank">/r/ComedyCemetery</A>. Along with using other WebComics, FuckDad also uses assets like the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trollface-coolface-problem" target="_blank">Trollface</A>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Frog" target="_blank">Crazy Frog</A>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minions_(Despicable_Me)" target="_blank">Minions</a>, and many more.</p>
<p>
The comic takes the most ideas from <a href="http://foxdad.com/" target="_blank">Michael Young's <em>Fox Dad</em></A>, a WebComic that follows the life of a furry dad, a comic OwlMan himself made a review for in December 2017;
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
<em>Fox Dad</em> has no offensive or NSFW content in any comic and is quite family friendly - <em>not that you would want to read it with any family members around</em> - and because it's so family friendly I honestly can't really find anything wrong with it, <em>it's just a fun little comic to read now and then.</em>
<P>
The comic for me is a "so bad it's good" - as in, the majority of the jokes that are made are furry related (i.e. <a href="http://foxdad.com/random" target="_blank">any of the pages</A>) and I'm told that the jokes are using "<a href="https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Furspeech" target="_blank">Furspeech</A>" - a language that shares ideas with <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet" target="_blank">l33t</A>, mostly because only <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spaz#Noun" target="_blank">spastics</a> use it - and even though the comic is made up of <em>Furspeech</em> puns, it's quite easy for a none-furry like myself to understand the jokes.</p>
<p>
<em>[...]</em></p>
<p>In the end, would I recommend Fox Dad to anyone? Well yeah, I guess I would, I'd recommend it to furries and people who want a quick read.
