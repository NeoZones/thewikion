<h1>Hello There!</h1>
<p>
Why hello there, you somehow found this page, good job! Here's a drawing of me next to a <a href="cuntyolk.html">Cunt Yolk</A> poster. So far there are no posters for the band, but even if there were I might not want to hang it on my wall, people will start asking questions, uh well, that's the price you pay for art I guess.
<p>
Anyway, Cunt Yolk rock!
