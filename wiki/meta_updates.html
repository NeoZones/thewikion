Not much has been done this month, however, I might might change the URL from my <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org">OwlMan</a> website, to the <a href="https://hyperlink.neocities.org">Hyperlink</a> one.
<p>
This upcoming quote is from the Hyperlink Discrod server from the 22/07/18;
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
[19:20] OwlMan: Just to ask, but if I were to say, upload a Neocities like-wikia to Hyperlink that I mat or may not have been working on for a number of months that covers not only the culture, history, and people behind Neocites, would anyone be interested in helping me run it?
<p>
[19:23] elementz: hmm
<p>
[19:55] Pizza Squeeze: we should make a separate discord server and neocities website for that @OwlMan
<p>
[20:32] elementz: @Pizza Squeeze @OwlMan yea we should make a discord for neowiki
<p>
[20:33] OwlMan: It's not called neowiki, it's called "The Blagger's Guide to The Culture of Neocities"
<p>
[20:33] OwlMan: (60 plus articles so far)
<p>
[20:34] Pizza Squeeze: then lets call it tbgtcn
<p>
[20:34] OwlMan: With articles on such things as the Neocities IRC, WebComics, DDoS attacks, music, and more

I still need to work on that Banana Chan article, I'm sure it will be the death of me. Today I was working on an article on <a href="new_ownership_of_the_openbooks_website.html">the new ownership of the OpenBooks website</A>.
<p>
Today I was also looking at the <a href="https://10kb.neocities.org">10kb website</a>, as I recalled that one of the artists saw that their art was used on the site, and they called Froge something on the lines of a "cult leader", or something like that. I really want to find that page, and write about it. I'm sure if Froge was working on TBG, he would have written a 9000 plus word article on the subject, but only 20 words were on the dedicated subject at hand, and the rest of the words were about how he is a <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#Bisexual">bisexual</A> <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/amiafurry/index.html">furry</A>.

<p>
Oh boy, a new month.
<p>
Since I last made an update here, I have written a few new articles. today I want to write an article on Banana Chan, I'm sure that's going to be a pain in the arse to do, (not that I'm saying their work is bad, I'm saying that there is just so much to look at), so that might take some time to do.
<p>
I also want to cover comics by Benji Nate very soon.
<p>
Today I was working on an article about <a href="people_kyle_drake.html">Kyle Drake</a>, but the article is just so small, all I have on the page right now is just "Kyle Drake is an American software/Web developer who was one of the key people who helped make Neocities.", and a photo of Drake. I might need to ask my Discord server about things to write on him.

<p>
I plan on writing articles on a number of WebComics, so far
<p>
 <ul>
  <li>DRAGONBITCH - <a href="https://dragonbitch.neocities.org/">https://dragonbitch.neocities.org/</a></li>
  <li>OwlMan Comic - <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/comic/">https://owlman.neocities.org/comic/</A></li>
  <li>FuckDad - <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/fdad/">https://owlman.neocities.org/fdad/</a></li>
  <li>Robot &#x26; Human - <a href="https://robotandhuman.neocities.org/">https://robotandhuman.neocities.org/</a></li>
  <li>Banana Chan (not a comic, but still) - <a href="https://bananachan.neocities.org/">https://bananachan.neocities.org/</A></li>
  <li>The Dandelion Patch! - <a href="https://dandelionpatch.net/">https://dandelionpatch.net/</A>/<a href="https://neocities.org/site/dentdelion">https://neocities.org/site/dentdelion</A></li>
  <li>Comics by Benji Nate (might be one or more articles, who knows?) - <a href="https://girlbenji.neocities.org/">https://girlbenji.neocities.org/</A></li>
  <li>Cappy Comics - <a href="https://gwtagacw.neocities.org/capy/">https://gwtagacw.neocities.org/capy/</A></li>
  <li>MS Life - <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/mslife/">https://owlman.neocities.org/mslife/</A></li>
</ul>
<p>
and I'm sure that I've missed more. I've read some of the comics in the past like some stuff by Benji Nate, and of cause I made FuckDad/OwlMan Comic, so I already know most things about it, but what is going to be annoying is reading some of the _<i>bad</i>_ comics.
<p>
I'm not going to name any of the bad ones, but I'll just say that some (only about two) of the comics listed are kind of... bad...
<p>
I might work on the Cappy Comics first as they are quite good, and I won't feel so bad.

Last night I was working hard on writing about three newsletters, that being <a href="jakeonline_weekly_newsletter.html">The JakeOnline Weekly Newsletter</A>, <a href="hot_garbage_newsletter.html">The Hot Garbage Newsletter</A>, and <a href="owlmail.html">OwlMail</a>.
<p>
Today I was working on the sidebar page, plus I fully completed the logo for <a href="meta_about.html">The Blagger's Guide</A>, as seen below this text. I think it looks really cool, much better than what I was expecting. The logo is made up of <a href="penelope.html">Penelope</A> and the <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/favicon.ico">OwlMan favicon</A>.
<p>
<center>
<img src="img/blagger_logo.png">
</center>
<p>
I'm still unsure to what the URL for The Blagger's Guide should be, I was thinking it should be <tt><a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/wiki/">https://owlman.neocities.org/wiki/</A></tt>, but the thing is that The Blagger's Guide is not a wiki as, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">to quote Wikipedia</A>;
<p>
<tt><blockquote>
A wiki (/&#x2C8;w&#x26A;ki/ (About this sound listen) WIK-ee) is a website on which users collaboratively modify content and structure directly from the web browser. In a typical wiki, text is written using a simplified markup language and often edited with the help of a rich-text editor.
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
So I'm really not sure, I might make the URL something like /blagger/, /tbg/, /tbgttcon/.
