<p>
<a href="https://minerobber.neocities.org/neowiki/" target="_blank"><em>neowiki</em></a> is a wiki that was first made pubic in early September 2018 by minerobber, the wiki itself follows that of Neocities, and the community surrounding it.</p>

<p>
The wiki is in part maintained on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, where people can edit articles. Some of the articles as of September 2018 are; <em><a href="https://minerobber.neocities.org/neowiki/neocities_cli.html">Neocities CLI</a></em>, <em><a href="https://minerobber.neocities.org/neowiki/supporter.html">Supporter Plan</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://minerobber.neocities.org/neowiki/site_profile.html">Site Profile</a></em>.</p>
<p>
The neowiki has some similarities to <a href="meta_about.html">Penny's Pages</A>, for example, both of the wikis were made in the later half of 2018, both of the wikis use an open license of some sort (<a href="meta_copyright.html">Creative Commons for Penny's Pages</A>, and a <a href="https://github.com/MineRobber9000/neowiki/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank">MIT License for neowiki</A>), and both have a lot of things in common on the style guide.</p>
