The "Trump Plan" (also known as "The Fat Cat Plan") was first set up on the 27th of April 2017 as a rebuttal to the FCC's prepositional to scrap <a href="net_neutrality.html">Net Neutrality</A>.
<p>
If your IP address said you were in the US Senate, the FCC, the White House, or a Trump hotel you would have seen this page that informs the viewer of what the Trump Plan is all about.
<p>
It was implemented to oppose anti net neutrality lobbyists, and the plan is much more limited than a typical standard account. It has only 2 MB of storage and 604 MB of bandwidth. Additionally, any accounts with the plan have a unique Fat Cat profile badge.
