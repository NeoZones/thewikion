Artwork by Capy for The Wiki

Late in the life of Hyperlink, the wiki was hosted on the webhome, in this time, Capy made a number of artwork for the wiki that would have been CC BY-NC-SA 3.0. In the time that the wiki was apart of Hyperlink, mari removed all of the work made by Capy, claiming that she asked him too, however, no prof that she asked him to remove all of her artwork was ever shown, what's more is that Capy made no attempt to comment on this - even when a handful of members from Hyperlink asked her about it.

It it then in our good judgement that unless Capy herself objects to out use of her artwork, or that mari shows us that he worked in her wishes, then we shell continue to host her artwork indefinitely.
