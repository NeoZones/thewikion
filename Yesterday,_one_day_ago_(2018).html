<em>Yesterday, one day ago</em> is the first EP by German Neocities user <a href="https://strata.neocities.org/">Strata</a>. The EP features samples of a number of audio tracks from Willy Wonka &#x26; the Chocolate Factory, Twin Peaks, and Synthetic Substitution, along with 10 other samples (13 in total) just to name a few. In all, the small album has 8 original music tracks in it, lasting just over 20 minutes.

The EP was published as a free download via Strata's website on 2018-04-07.

For the README file of the download (<tt>LinerNotes.txt</tt>), Strata writes that all of the tracks were created, mixed, and finished in Ableton Live 9, along with making a tank you section;

<pre>THANK YOU
=========
First, I'd like to thank you, dear listener, for listening to this heap
of shit. I'd also like OwlMan ...
	1) For giving the valuable feedback I did
	   not want to hear during the refinement of these tracks.
	2) For hosting the Opus files for web-based listening.</pre>

A whole year later on 2019-04-11, Strata published a fair well letter from the host (<a href="https://strata.neocities.org/gush/19/04/leaving.html">Strata leaves the host</a>), on the webpage, they link to a previously unseen track that they made, Running High '99, an "unfinished, and probably mixed poorly" that its title is a reference to the first opening track of <em>Yesterday, one day ago</em>, that being Running Low '98.
