<h2>Bannerlink</h2>
WSMZ offers a free-to-use banner ad service, <a href="https://hbaguette.neocities.org/other/bannerlink/">Bannerlink</a>, offering anybody the oppurtunity to advertise themselves as long as they meet the "don't be a dick" quota. There are currently 22 ads running on the service, 3 of which being for Baguette's own pages.
<p>
Bannerlink is free to add to your site, with the only requirement being to add the following iframe:
<pre>&#x3C;iframe width=&#x22;468&#x22; height=&#x22;60&#x22; style=&#x22;border:none&#x22; src=&#x22;https://hbaguette.neocities.org/bannerlink/embed.html&#x22; name=&#x22;bannerlink&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/iframe&#x3E;</pre>
<p>
<h2>Webrings</h2>
WSMZ is a member of 2 webrings, the [[Hotline Webring]] and the Ringlink webring, a webring that is also hosted on the site.
