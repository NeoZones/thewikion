<p>
<strong>wastebot</strong> is the name of a Discord bot made by Heather of wastebin, with the tag of <tt>wastebot#0730</tt>. The "primary goal" of the bot "is to not exclude contributors on the basis of innate, benign, or imposed characteristics or circumstances" (<A href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/wastebot?path=CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:1:0">The code of conduct for the bot</a>).
<p>
The bot first publicly when online on 2018-12-15 (<a href="https://ptb.discordapp.com/channels/518643619956260874/519072495597256712/523364113359831040">The bot's first public words on wastebin's Discord server</a>) on the night mode Discord server, although humorously, line 10 of its code suggests that the bot was first started on 1970-01-01.
<p>
<h2>Languages of The Bot</h2>
The bot itself is written in Python. wastebot's full source code is rather small, making up only 66 lines of code (<A href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/wastebot?path=wastebot.py">wastebot.py</a>), in comparison to this, the main body of work for another bot that Heather helped with, [[OwlBot]], has 1762 lines of code (<a href="https://github.com/DynTylluan/OwlBot/blob/master/index.js#L1762">OwlBot's <tt>index.js</tt></a>).
<p>
Because of this, by using English commands, people are able to give themselves such things as color roles by posting <tt>%color</tt> followed by the name of the color that they desire (<tt>%color that one crayon nobody uses</tt>, for example).
<p>
An extract of the code is show below;
<pre># HELP

help_commands = ("help", "hello", "roles", "enrole", "derole", "color", "bleach")

async def help_action(msg, invoc):
	name = invoc[1]
	if name:
		if name in commands:
			await msg.channel.send("`%{0.name}`: {0.desc} Usage: `{0.usage}`.".format(commands[name]))
		else:
			await msg.channel.send("`uhh, %{}` isnâ€™t even a command. for more information, type `%help`.".format(name))
	else:
		await msg.channel.send("Commands: {}".format(", ".join(map("`{}`".format, help_commands))))

commands["help"] = Command("help", "prompts the bot to list commands or describe the specified command.", "%help [%&#x3C;command name>]", re.compile("\s*%help(?:\s+%([a-z-]+))?\s*$"), help_action)</pre>

In this example, the line that starts with "<tt>help_commands</tt>" shows all of the commands without needing the <tt>%</tt> prefix, it also shows what happens if someone types in something that isn't a code (if they made a typo would be an example of this), if that was to happen, then the bot would correct that person.
