Discjoppie (also called <strong>DISCJOPPIE</strong>) is the name of a music side-project that is made up of experimental sounds, produced, and published by Neocities user <a href="https://joppiesaus.neocities.org/">Joppiesaus</a> in 2017-07. So far, there are only two track released, that being Gesundheit (decried as a techno song) and Robot (this time decried as the genre of "???").
<p>
For the webpage of the project, Joppiesaus writes that they are "having fun learning to produce and mix music. I hope you'll like it! And if you don't, that's also okay!", they follow it up by saying "All of this is entirely experimental. I'm not sure what music I like, nor am I sure what I want to produce".
