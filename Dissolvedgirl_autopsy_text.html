<strong>FINAL ANATOMIC DIAGNOSES:</strong>
<blockquote>
    1. Massive injury to the head characterized by:<br>
    A. Scalp lacerations.<br>
    B. Extensive fracturing, much of which is comminuted with associated fracture fragments, skull.<br>
    C. Entrance wound, roof of mouth with fracturing and lacerations of the hard and soft palates.<br>
    D. Cavitary defect in the top of the skull, also involving the right and left parietal and temporal areas representing an exit wound.<br>
    E. Fractures to the facial bones.
</blockquote>
2. Fractured neck involving Cl and C2 with transection of the spinal cord.
<br>
<br>
COMMENT: The autopsy findings in this case indicate that the cause of death is due to massive head injury secondary to blunt force trauma sustained from a through-and-through shotgun wound involving the mouth and an exit wound involving the upper posterior aspect of the left side of the head. A positive scientific identification was established with DNA technology.

This autopsy is performed in the Clear Creek County Coroner's Office in Idaho Springs, Colorado on April 19, 2019. The examination was initiated at 10:00 a.m. and continued for three hours, concluding at 1:00 p.m. This autopsy is done at the request of Chris Hegmann, the coroner of Clear Creek County. Mr. Hegmann attended the autopsy, assisted me in the autopsy, and identified the decedent to me. Additional identification is by provided by a tag encircling the right wrist bearing the name "Sol Pais." Shawna Gilbert, the lead investigator in the case also attended the autopsy.

<strong>HISTORY</strong>: This is the case of an 18-year-old white female who was discovered at the trail head off the grounds of the Echo Lake Lodge slightly off the trail, the apparent victim of a shotgun wound involving the oral cavity. Permanent identification is by personal effects and a passport picture. Scene investigation revealed the presence of a shotgun between her legs, personal effects, and a duffle bag. No significant past medical history is available at the time of autopsy. The discovery date was April 17, 2019.

<strong>TOXICOLOGY</strong>:
<br>
<br>
Blood: I obtained one gray-stoppered test tube of blood from the heart. I obtained two purple-stoppered test tubes of blood from the heart. I obtained one red-stoppered test tube of blood from the heart.
<br>
<br>
Urine: I obtained two gray-stoppered test tubes of pale urine.
<br>
<br>
Vitreous Humor: I obtained one gray and one red-stoppered test tubes of vitreous humor. Additionally, I obtained one vial of liver, one vial of gastric contents, and I obtained one gray-stoppered test tube of bile.
<br>
<br>
<strong>TRACE EVIDENCE</strong>:
<br>
<br>
I obtained one flattened lead pellet measuring 5/8" x 3/8". This had fallen out of the cranial vault when a head block had been placed underneath the head. Also falling out was a piece of silver-gray metal measuring 5/16" in length, also a piece of white, which appears to be plastic material. This is flattened, measuring 1-1/2" x 1" and had fallen through the base of the skull.
<br>
<br>
These are appropriately measured, described, and given to Lt. Steve Guggenheim, head of the Crime Lab in the Clear Creek County Sheriffs Office.
<br>
<br>
With respect to possible identification by DNA of the decedent, I obtained buccal swabs from the mouth, psoas muscle, and two purple test tubes of blood. One purple-stoppered test tube of blood is given to Lt. Guggenheim and a second purple-stoppered test tube of blood will be packaged with the toxicology specimens and stored for one year at the ChemaTox toxicology laboratory.
