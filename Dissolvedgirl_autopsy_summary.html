<p>
Dr Ben Galloway, who also <a href="http://www.acolumbinesite.com/autopsies.php">seemly preformed the autopsy</a> of <a href="http://www.acolumbinesite.com/autopsies/eric.gif">Eric Harris</a> and <a href="http://www.acolumbinesite.com/autopsies/eric.gif">Dylan Klebold</a> (the Columbine shooters), along with one of their victims, <a href="http://www.acolumbinesite.com/autopsies/danm.gif">Daniel Mauser</a>, wrote in the report that "<tt>[The] autopsy [took place] in the Clear Creek County Coroner's Office <em>[...]</em> on April 19, 2019</tt>". The examination of the body took three hours "<tt>at the request of Chris Hegmann, the coroner of Clear Creek County. Mr. Hegmann attended the autopsy, assisted [Dr. Galloway] in the autopsy, and identified the decadent to [Dr. Galloway]. <em>[...]</em> Shawna Gilbert, the lead investigator in the case also attended the autopsy</tt>".
<p>
As suspected by the media, Pais likely shot herself, the report writes that;
<p>
<blockquote><tt>COMMENT: The autopsy findings in the case indicate that <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the cause of death is due to a massive head injury secondary to blunt force trauma sustained from a through-and-through shotgun wound</span> involving the mouth and an exit wound involving the upper posterior aspect of the left side of the head. A positive scientific identification was established with DNA technology.</tt></blockquote>
<p>
Due to the nature of the circumstances of the events surrounding that of Pais' death, it has been suggested that Pais had some kind of mental illness or condition, however, in the report it says "<tt>No significant past medical history is available at the time of autopsy</tt>" - this '''does not''' rule out the possibility that Pais '''did''' have any issues on record, but rather that the documents (if there are '''even any''') have not been found or submitted to Clear Creek County Coroner's Office at the time of the autopsy.
<p>
The report makes reference to "<tt>EXTERNAL EXAMINATION</tt>" (meaning what Pais was wearing). Below is a large part of the text, with highlights to parts that are of interest...
<p>
<blockquote><tt>The body is clothed in a long sleeved, blue, gray, and tan flannel plaid shirt bloodstained on the left shoulder. This is consistent with the position of discovery, which is on the decedent's left side. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">The body was also clothed in black pants [trousers]</span> with a black belt with some tissue attached to the upper right thigh; <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">long sleeve black shirt; black boots; two types of stockings; one of which is a knee-length black sock, the other connected pair consisting of black panties; black hose; black socks, and black lace, brief-type panties. Black gloves with exposed fingers are present on each hand</span>.</tt></blockquote>
<p>
The report carries on by stating that "<tt>The antecubital fossae reveal no evidence of recent needle puncture marks or scars. The upper arms are intact and unremarkable grossly.</tt>", this means that, as you might imagine, that Pais had not taken any drugs that you inject into yourself or had any self-harm marks on her person, to further this, the report has a subsection dedicated to the toxicology of their person, for context, here is the section in full;
<p>
<blockquote><tt>'''TOXICOLOGY:'''
Blood Alcohol <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">None detected</span><br>
Urine Alcohol <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">None detected</span><br>
Vitreous Alcohol <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">None detected</span><br>
Blood Drug Screen <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">None detected</span></tt></blockquote>
<p>
So at lest at the time, Pais was not under the influence of any drugs (legal or other), alcohol (the sate law of Colorado's drinking age is 21; Pais was only 18), or even anything else that would be of note.
<p>
Dr. Galloway would conduct the internal examination, starting off by doing "<tt>the usual Y-shaped incision</tt>" (cutting up the chest, going just past the nipples, then cutting in a literal Y-shape so that they may view the inside of the body), the report follows off by telling the reader that the internal body of Pais is "<tt>intact</tt>" and "<tt>seemly normal</tt>". The "<tt>seemly normal</tt>" comment can rather summarise the full report.
<p>
The trace evidence subsection states that a "<tt>silver-gray metal</tt>" was found in her person. Trace evidence is made in a post-mortem examination when an objects makes contact with the body of the deceased. The report reads in full;
<p>
<blockquote><tt>TRACE EVIDENCE: I obtained <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">one flattened lead pellet</span> measuring 5/8" x 3/8". <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">This had fallen out of the cranial vault when a head block had been placed underneath the head</span>. Also falling out was <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a piece of silver-gray metal</span> measuring 5/16" in length, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">also a piece of white, which appears to be plastic material</span>. This is flattened, measuring 1-1/2" x 1" <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">and had fallen through the base of the skull</span>.</tt></blockquote>
<p>
Page seven of the suggest a second report from Lt. Guggenheim, although this might not be the case at all, and perhaps it is just a misunderstanding of the wording.
<p>
<blockquote><tt>With respect to possible identification by DNA of the decedent, I obtained buccal swabs from the mouth, psoas muscle, and two purple test tubes of blood. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">One purple-stoppered test tube of blood is given to Lt. Guggenheim and a second purple-stoppered test tube of blood will be packaged with the toxicology specimens and stored for one year at the ChemaTox toxicology laboratory</span>.</tt></blockquote>
<p>
As stated at the start of this overview, when it comes to the report, most things stated in it is not all that unexpected if you have been following the first reports of Pais' death. As guessed, Sol Pais shot herself in the head, killing herself. Her gun was found on her person. She had on dark colours, black trousers, and fingerless gloves.
