<h2>Tracks of Beat Your Kids (Before I Do It)</h2>
<strong>Beat Your Kids (Before I Do It)</strong><br>
This is the first track of the EP, the song is about how the singer is always annoyed by unruly children and how he want the parents to beat their children so that they won't make a lot of noise, if they don't beat them, then he'll do it himself.

The cover for this song is a still from "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122173758/http://my.mixtape.moe/ldgyow.mp4">Hitman for Hire</a>", a video made by <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/2killers.html">Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold</a> from their so-called "Basement Tapes". Harris and Klebold were the two young men who committed the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, killing 15 (including both perpetrators). This song is unique as it has two covers -- cover one has the Cunt Yolk nude lady logo on, and the second one does not. This was made so YouTube would not remove the song for having nudity in the video.</p>
